## Overview ##

This tutorial is intended as a one-stop guide to understanding and using PsychoPy/Pavlovia. It will assume zero coding knowledge, but I will cover ways to use custom code components to a) make experiments easier to build and tweak, and b) overcome limitations of the builder flow. I will also supply a set of example PsychoPy experiments and templates, which show how various problems can be solved through the builder and through custom code.

## Credit ##

Andrew wrote the entire tutorial and deserves credit for doing the heavy lifting. Rich provided edits to the text and tweaked the structure to work with R Markdown 
and therefore be easier to share with others. Rich knows almost nothing about
PsychoPy, so if you have questions, please ask Andrew. 

## Motivation ##

There are many other very good PsychoPy tutorials, including those created by the 
PsychoPy team. The motivation behind this tutorial is to provide a home-grown, lab-based tutorial that benefited from having someone (Andrew) who
is familiar with the types of approaches used in Rich's lab (www.rich-ramsey.com), which are based in experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The benefit of doing so is that Andrew could cover the types of questions, designs and problems that we often face. Andrew could also provide worked examples that my lab should find familiar and useful. So, consider the tutorial a lab guide that has a public face because why not make it open, so others may benefit.
