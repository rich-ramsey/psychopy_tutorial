# Basic Template

*By Andrew Wildman*

---
This is a basic ratings task with several convenience elements built-in. The setup routine at the start of the experiment specifies most of the parameters used by components throughout the experiment (positions, sizes, durations etc.), including a list of elements used for the rating scale. Images are AI generated faces (block 1) and whole persons (block 2).

There is also a switchable debug mode which prints the current block and stimulus to the screen.

Once you have modified the template as desired, remember to update both 1) the name of the .psyexp file, and 2) the name of the experiment under "Experiment Settings".
