# Randomising Stimuli without Repetition

*By Andrew Wildman*

This builder project reads in a set of image file paths from a spreadsheet (with a set number of repeats) then re-randomises these so that the same image cannot appear on two consecutive trials.

5 AI-generated stimuli are used as examples (with a default of 5 repeats, for a total of 25 trials), and "left" and "right" arrowkeys are used for the response.
