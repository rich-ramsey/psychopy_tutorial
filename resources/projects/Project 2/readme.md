# Definine Stimulus Parameters Through Code

*By Andrew Wildman*

This experiment uses code with some basic logic to 1) exit the trials loop early based on the number of trials requested at the start, and 2) save an additional data point, which reflects whether the position of the polygon on the current trial matches that of the previous trial.

Stimulus position and correct answers (arrow key that corresponds to the stimlus position) are determined by the conditions file.
