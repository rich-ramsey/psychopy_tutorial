# Builder Demonstration - GNG Task

*By Andrew Wildman*

This basic Go/No-Go task is designed to demonstrate how to implement blocks and trials using only the basic builder tools and no custom code components. Here, a conditions file called blocks.xlsx is used to set 1) the instructions to display on-screen before the block begins and 2) which conditions file to use for the trials.

The task is a simple Go/No-Go paradigm using the space key, however the colours flip in the second block and the participant is asked to respond Go for red and No-Go for green.
